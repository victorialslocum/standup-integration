# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the only Slack to Notion standup integration you'll ever need
### This was wayyyy more difficult than it looks ðŸ˜¢

Wow I learned a ton doing this. Slack and Notion have great APIs and helpful docs, but being as new to this as I am, it took a lot of trial and error. A big part of this was figuring out how to translate Slack messages into stuff Notion can understand. You can find that whole project [here](https://github.com/victoriaslocum752/slack-notion-translation). 

 
# Features ðŸ“Š  
## Parent Message  
This code will send a parent Slack message to a Notion database, complete with a title, properties, and a perfectly formatted body.  

### Title  
- split based on any punctuation mark or a new line
- formatted without link or user ickness
- character limit of 100
- emojis!!  

### Properties  
- user who sent the Slack message
- date created
- multi-select tags
- link to the original slack message  

### Body  
- text formatting for 
  - `code`
  - [links](https://findtheinvisiblecow.com/)
  - **bold text**
  - *italicized text*
  - ~~strikethrough~~
  - bullet points
  - (I think) ordered lists
- tagging users is automaticly done
- text links are formatted right]
- emojis!!

## Thread message  
It will also update a Notion page with the thread message, with all the correct formatting.  

### Example formatting:   
```
@Victoria Slocum says: This is a great additional item to a Notion page!! 
```

## Channel Topic  
We found it helpful to have the channel topic be updated with the currect tags in use.  

This code will automatically update the channel topic when a new tag is added!!  

## Reply with Link
The Standup Bot will reply in the thread with the link to the created Notion page  

 
# Overall flow ðŸŒŠ
